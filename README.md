We currently use Panel/Bokeh and Web Assembly to deploy our visualization on
GitHub Pages.

### Usage
You can run the visualization yourself using the `circadian_rythm_interactive.ipynb` notebook.
To use without dependency problems, it is recommended to use the Conda environment `environment.yml` as
kernel for your Jupyter server.
